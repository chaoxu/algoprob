title: collection of ordered elements
problem:
  description: maintain a collection of elements, the elements has an order and can be compared.
  queries:
    - name: initialize
      description: initialize(X)
      input: 
        - collection of elements in X
      output:
        - initialized data structure that contains all elements in X
      parameters:
        - name: n
          description: the size of $S$
    - name: insert
      description: insert(S,x)
      input: element x
    - name: delete
      description: delete(S,x)
      input: element x
    - name: search
      description: search(S,x)
      input: element x
      output: 
        - description: the largest element no larger than x
parameters:
  - name: n
    description: size of $S$
data-structures:
  - description: balanced binary search tree
    complexity:
      - name: insert
        complexity: $O(\log n)$
      - name: delete
        complexity: $O(\log n)$
      - name: search
        complexity: $O(\log n)$
      - name: initialize
        complexity: $O(n\log n)$, $O(n)$ if the initialized elements are sorted.
