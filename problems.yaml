title: Bottleneck $k$-link path
problem: Given a complete DAG with ordered weights, find a path consists of $k$ edges from $v_1$ to $v_n$, such that the maximum weight of the edges in the path is minimized.

The weight is called ordered, if $w(i,j)<w(i,j+1)$ and $w(i+ 1,j)<w(i,j)$. We are interested in the most general form, where the elements can only be compared.
